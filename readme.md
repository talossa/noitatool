# HOW TO INSTALL:
please put this entire "noitatool\" folder into your noita mods directory (rightclick noita in 
steam -> manage 
-> browse local files -> mods)

for the seed changer to work, you need to enable the associated mod inside the game's mod settings. if something here is malfunctioning, sometimes 
disabling other seed changers might do the trick.


# GENERAL INFO:
i did this mostly as a very simple exercise in batch scripting, and most of the code i used is borrowed from 
elsewhere. 

i have tried my hardest to bend the code so that it works nicely together as one package, but many 
issues may arise from this, and the end result is very spaghetti-y indeed. 

feel free to tinker with it though, and share your own variations! :D

if you have issues with the tool or ideas to possibly implement, please tell me about it on the reddit thread or on twitter 
at @unnifi, and i'll see what i can do.


# ATTRIBUTION AND THANKS:
HootzMcToke for creating NoitaSaveTool.cmd which the entire GUI and saving system is ripped from:
github.com/hootzmctoke/noitasavetool

Dregu for creating Start with custom seed.zip, which the seed editor is based on:
modworkshop.net/mod/25898

also, literally countless stackoverflow and superuser threads for teaching me the basics of the batch script, and Arska for 
helping me test the damn thing.

# Cheers for downloading it, do let me know what you think!
